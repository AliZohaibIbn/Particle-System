# Particle-System
Basic Particle System (Core).

This is a basic particle system written in C++ and Graphics from SFML. Basically, You can create particles using the generative feature or manually add by 
left clicking at the position you would like to add. This is quite literally the core concept of most particle physics projects and applications.
Some inspiration was taken from Pezzza's Work. I watched the video and then made this project.
